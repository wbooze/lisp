("One of the attractions of CL is that the strings
include newline characters, so one can just type in
unparsed character data into large strings that run
on for lots of lines of lots of characters"

"TeX is the king of typesetting input languages. If one has
a lot of plain text to type set, one just types it in."

"Unfortunately that is not the whole story. Various characters are used
to mark up the input. $ & % # _ { and } are easily produced, with
\\$ \\& \\% \\# \\_ \\{ \\}"

"However, the first edition of the LaTeX manual explains that
~ ^ and \\ usually appear only in simulated keyboard input.
Simulated keyboard input is entered using the \"verbatim\"
environment, so ~ ^ and \\ are escaped as:"

"\\begin{verbatim}
~ ^ \\
\\end{verbatim}"

"At that time, even avante garde thinkers, such as Knuth,
had no cause to trouble themselves over the law of migration to
middle-ware. The problem is that eventually TeX input files would
be written by computers as much as they would be typed in. 
Except that the quoting rules are vexacious. To use TeX as
middleware one needs to be able write code that quotes strings,
reliably and automatically." )
